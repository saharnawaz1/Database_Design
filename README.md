Welcome! 
Here you'll files created for a class project that had that following requirements: 
.ipynb notebook(s) containing the following :
Markdown cells explaining the process used within your script we built in class (or a database you created for own use) and subsequent SQL code cells, for both: 
- the DDL (table builds) -  for the MDL and for the SQL Code itself
- and the Data Loading Scripts -  for the MDL and for the SQL Code itself

Using draw.io create a diagram of the datamart and include it on your GitHub repository along with the .ipynb(s) as shown above
